thread from programm : virtual CPU that has curernt processing state of programm
thread from OS/CPU : state preserved processing, stopping time

OS processes a thread and changes it to the other thread.
It starts processing with a certain order every short seconds.

Thread is mapped to CPU core, but goroutine is mapped to an OS's thread that is one virtual CPU.

So, Go runtime a kind of imitates OS.
